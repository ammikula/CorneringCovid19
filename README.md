>>>> Other notes or comments to the grader:
    Some things in this program are hard-coded to fit the data files I was able to upload for COVID.  
In a perfect world, I would have the file automatically be added to the program so that way
the user can have all the data updated to fit their exact present time. 

>>  In another perfect world, I would be able to show data for ALL countries in the world,
but unfortunately this is just for the US states.

>>>> Problems:
    In the larger states, such as Florida or California, the maximum case number may be higher
than reality because the case number grew at such a fast pace that with some missing data in files
and some files unable to be read it became moderately inaccurate. But, this is notified to the user.

>>>> Future Work Ideas:
1. I would ideally like to make this for all countries
2. A "Go Back" button on newScene to go back to start

>>> 1. sceneOne_invalidInput.png : shows user interface with invalid input
>>> 2. sceneTwo_allData.png : show user interface with all valid input
